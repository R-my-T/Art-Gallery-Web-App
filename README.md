# Art-Gallery-Web-App

## About:
An online art gallery where artists can upload their artworks and interact with the audience. The tech stack used for the web application includes SQLite, Flask, Python, HTML, CSS and Java script. Artists can create account, upload, edit or delete their artwork and can also categorize them under the genres defined by the admin. Those who do not have an account can still view the artworks and can also support the artists through the 'send love' option. 

## Future Scope:
We can connect viewers who wish to buy artworks to the respective artists directly by providing them the artist's email. In the future this can be extended into a full fledged     shopping portal or an auction site thus helping beginner artists earn a livelihood.
